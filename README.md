In this project, we have a platform(website) in which shopping departments have the ability to purchase and sell their products.They may have existing stores on other platforms, such as a shop created with WooCommerce. Their goal is to integrate these stores to ensure synchronization across all platforms. Additionally, they may wish to create a sample store in WooCommerce. To facilitate this, we have developed a code that gathers the dataset of the relevant store and imports the products into their WooCommerce account. Unfortunately, the dataset is private and cannot be accessed.
